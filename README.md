# did-kr-spec
A standardized extension for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) enabling secure, interoperable key recovery through three complementary mechanisms: Social ZKP Recovery (threshold guardians with zero-knowledge proofs), Deterministic Seedling Inheritance (HD seeds with VDF time-locks), and MPC-Mediated Recovery (fROST threshold signatures with proactive share refreshment). Features Verifiable Secret Sharing, Verifiable Delay Functions, guardian privacy enhancements, provider state synchronization, and comprehensive security considerations. Implements DID Core extension with JSON-LD context for machine-readable discovery.
